# Decentralized Commercial Insurance Claims

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based system for managing commercial insurance claims through smart contracts. By decentralizing the claims process, this solution enhances transparency, reduces fraud, accelerates settlements, and creates an immutable audit trail for all stakeholders in the commercial insurance ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Policy Verification Contract
- Validates insurance coverage terms and conditions in real-time
- Maintains immutable records of policy details and endorsements
- Automates coverage verification against reported incidents
- Stores policy exclusions, limits, and deductibles
- Ensures policy status and premium payment verification

### Incident Documentation Contract
- Records comprehensive details of insured events with timestamps
- Manages secure storage of evidence including photos, videos, and reports
- Creates tamper-proof chain of custody for incident documentation
- Implements structured data collection for consistent reporting
- Enables multi-party attestation of incident circumstances

### Adjuster Assignment Contract
- Manages the claim investigation process workflow
- Assigns qualified adjusters based on expertise and availability
- Tracks investigation milestones and timelines
- Coordinates third-party specialist involvement when required

### Settlement Contract
- Handles payment and resolution of validated claims
- Automates settlement calculations based on policy terms
- Manages disbursement of funds to appropriate parties
- Records final claim disposition and associated documentation
